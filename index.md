#### Introduction

With over 80 members, Mounds View Science Olympiad is one of the largest and most successful academic teams at [Mounds View High School](http://www.moundsviewschools.org/moundsview). Coached by Mr. Michael Huberty, Mr. Dan Butler, and Mr. Thomas Carr, Mounds View has won the Minnesota State Tournament ten times â€“ a Minnesota state record.

[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is America's foremost team science competition, in which teams of up to 15 students compete in 23 different events, ranging from astronomy and entomology to bridge building and experimental design.. For each event, students work in teams of two to three students. Each year, Mounds View sends as many five teams of 15 members to 3-4 invitational tournaments and one regional tournament, and one team of 15 members to the state and national tournaments. With the inception of a new Hybrid Applied Science class in the past three years, students have the opportunity to earn academic credit for participation in Science Olympiad.

#### History

Mounds View Science Olympiad has upheld a tradition of success since its founding in 2002. It has won the Minnesota State Tournament ten times (2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016), the most in Minnesota Science Olympiad history. MVSO has also represented Minnesota at the Science Olympiad National Tournament in each of those ten years. At the 2014 National tournament, MVSO placed 2nd in the nation, its highest ranking ever. 

#### Middle school involvement

In recent years, the MVSO coaches and team has been involved in the formation and success of Science Olympiad organizations at Highview Middle School and Chippewa Middle School. New members of MVSO often come from one of these two teams and bring with them valuable competition experience and a passion for science.
